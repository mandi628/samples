(Introduction)

Project Title: This is the name of the project. It describes the whole project in one sentence, and helps people understand what the main goal and aim of the project is.

This project was originally an assignment while I was learning Python. I found it to be a lot
of fun, so I decided to continue building it. While it is currently based entirely on fiction,
my plan is to make it more realistic, in a logical sense.

I learned a lot about conditional statements in programming, but I also learned a lot about
plot and choice-driven narrative. This project really stretched my creativity and satisfied
my story-writing urges, as much as my programming urges.
