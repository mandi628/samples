# README.md

Welcome to Novelist, an open source creative writing app for all kinds of creative writers.
It is my hope to create an app for creative writers that will allow them to work on projects
on multiple devices, and allow them to sync accross Google Docs, GitHub, or Dropbox.

This project is inspired by yWriter, but hopes to fill a void allowing writers to work in real
time. Since yWriter is currently a desktop program, I'm hoping to bring it to the world of
mobile use, which is not currently a functionality it offers.
