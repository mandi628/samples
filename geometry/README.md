# README.md

## Geometry-1.0.0

This project was inspired by practice material in Python texts, especially related to functions.

I built this project to practice using functions, and in an attempt to use best practices in
CHANGELOG.md documentation, as well as making the code readable.

## What the project does

This application offers text-based menus which allow the user to calculate the perimeter, area,
or volume of various shapes. I used Python because it is the language I chose to start my
programming journey with, but I'm sure the same application can be written more effectively
in other languages.

One challenge I faced in writing this program is the length of it. Offering so many options to
the user made for a lot of repetition. One change I hope to implement is to attempt to use
less language in the code and get the same results. Any feedback on this point would be
appreciated.

Please see the CHANGELOG.md for a list of improvements I plan to make in future versions. Again,
this project is mostly an attempt to apply what I've learned from various textbooks and online
sources.

### Features

- Simple, text-based user menu
- Easy to understand written answers

## Why the project is useful

While Google offers easy access to calculations that require formulas, it's handy to have it
all in one place.

## How users can get started with the project

Currently, this application is only available in the command line with a Python interpreter
installed. It is my hope to offer it as a fully executeable package in the future.

### Installation How-To

1) Open your command line tool of choice.

2) Make sure you have a Python interpreter installed on your device.

3) Download the file to a destination of your choosing. You can copy and paste it to your
desired location, if necessary.

### How to Use the Project

To run the executeable Python file, change to the directory where you stored the file, then
simply type "./geometry-1-0-0.py" into your command line prompt. Or, type "python geometry-1-0-0.py".
You will be prompted in the app to enter the necessary data.
