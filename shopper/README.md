# README.md

Shopping Helper is a quick, light-weight shopping list app. I initially made the list to practice using lists and their functions while learning Python.

## What the project does

Currently, you can only view your list while in the app. Once you close the app, the list is no longer stored, and you have to start over again. But you can view your list, add to it, and remove items from it (like, when you add it to your cart).

The app is currently in Python, and works in the command line, or via Python interpreter. It is on the list to make it more user-friendly, and apply a graphic interface to it.
