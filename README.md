# mandi628 - Sample Projects

This is a collection of sample projects I've developed as I've worked through beginner coding
texts, both book and online formats. While many of these projects started as simple assignments,
I used what I learned to improve the initial idea and take it to the next level.

My hope is to use what I continue to learn to improve these even more, and to demonstrate
my abilities through the process.

I realize that at the time of this writing the code is quite basic. But I have noticed huge
improvements in my concept development and complexity as the weeks have gone. I will be
updating README and CHANGELOG files for each othe projects, and hope to develop some ideas
for advancement for each of the projects. I'd love some feedback, if anyone is so inclined.
